# Computer-Graphics
The lab in computer graphics with WebGL.

Features:
  Nice design in graphics.
  Providing two interactive ways.

Installation:
  Because the project will load the local file, which is not allowed by the most browsers, so
you have to build a little server by yourself. The most easy and common way to build a server
is to enter a python command line like this:
        python3 -m http.server 8888
  You are supposed to enter the above-mentioned command in this project's root directory. Then,
you enter localhost:8888 in the browser like Chrome, you can look through the whole project or
open the directory Src and click on index.html to run the program.
